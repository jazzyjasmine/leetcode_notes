## ðŸ¦€ Binary Tree <a id="binary-tree"></a>

### 1. Divide & Conquer
[1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/)  
[333. Largest BST Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-bst-subtree/)


### 2. Construct Tree by Two Different Traversals
Use recursion, find root and the span of left subtree (start and end) and the span of right subtree (start and end) on the array.  
[105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)  
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not preorder or not inorder:
            return None
        
        root = TreeNode(preorder[0])
        
        i = inorder.index(root.val)
        
        root.left = self.buildTree(preorder[1: i + 1], inorder[0: i])
        root.right = self.buildTree(preorder[i + 1: len(preorder)], inorder[i + 1: len(preorder)])
        
        return root
```

&nbsp;

## ðŸ¦€ Binary Search Tree (BST) <a id="binary-search-tree"></a>

### 1. BST Validation
The max value in left subtree is smaller than the root value and the min value in right subtree is larger than the root value.  
[333. Largest BST Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-bst-subtree/)

### 2. Predecessor & Successor
Predecessor: The prev node, i.e. the largest node before (smaller than) the current one.  

Find predecessor:  
1. If node has left child: One step left and then always right.
2. If node has no left child: The first node that is not having a "left" relationship with its parent.

Successor: The next node, i.e. the smallest node after (larger than) the current node.

Find successor:  
1. If node has right child: One step right and then always left.
2. If node has no right child: The first node that is not having a "right" relationship with its parent.

## ðŸ¦€ Graph: General<a id="graph-general"></a>

### Detect Cycle
Key: If there is a neighbor that has been visited, then there is a cycle.  
Can be solved by DFS, BFS, UnionFind.  
- For undirected graph, what's more complicated is that, each edge has two directions, so when a neighbor of the current node is the parent of current node, even though this neighbor is in the "visited" set, we should not say there is a cycle. We should exclude this scenario after checking whether a neighbor is in "visited".  
- For the DFS solution, we do not use backtracking (e.g. visited.add(neighbor), dfs(neighbor), visited.remove(neighbor)) because we need to get all visited sub nodes when we are to mark the current node as black (finish probing). Backtracking is used for getting all paths from a start to an end. After finish probing all sub nodes, backtracking keeps the "visited" set only the previous nodes till the current node, no sub nodes.  
[261. Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)

&nbsp;

## ðŸ¦€ Graph: DFS <a id="graph-dfs"></a>
- White: Not visited; Gray: Visited, probing; Black: Visited, finish probing.   
- Make deep copy whenever append a list to the result sets  
  [797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)
- Build graph and find recursion  
    [851. Loud and Rich](https://leetcode.com/problems/loud-and-rich/)


&nbsp;

## ðŸ¦€ Graph: Topological Sorting<a id="graph-topological-sorting"></a>
- DAG &harr; At least one topological sorting.  
  If DAG(directed acyclic graph), it must have at least one topological sorting.  
  If the graph has topological sorting, it must be a DAG.
- Build graph and identify topological sorting (identify DEPENDENCIES/PREREQUISITES)
- Use "visited" set to check if topological sorting exists

&nbsp;

## ðŸ¦€ Single-source Shortest Path <a id="single-source-shortest-path"></a>
### Dijkstra
Points:
- Remember the "visited" set, i.e. S, after the vertices popped out from the heap, they were added to the S, meaning that their shortest distance from the source vertex is found and fixed, i.e. d[u] = $\delta$(u, s). 
    
  There are two places to use the "visited":
  1. (Must) After a vertex is popped out from the heap, we need to check whether it is in the visited, if so, skip to the next iteration. If we don't do so, the heap will never become empty and thus endless loop.
  2. (Optional but recommended) For each neighbor of the popped-out-vertex, check if it is in the visited set, if so, skip. Not doing so will not cause error, but it keeps the unneccessary calculation.


Types of problems:
- Straightforward Dijkstra with extra work in the results set
